You cannot color plain text in a GitHub README.md file. You can however add color to code samples with the tags below.

To do this just add tags such as these samples to your README.md file:

```json
   // code for coloring
```
```html
   // code for coloring
```
```js
   // code for coloring
```
```css
   // code for coloring
```
